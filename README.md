# ImageTagger
This application allows users to upload, store, search for and tag images automatically using AI powered by Amazon Rekognition. To do this I built an API using Node.js and Express that utilized many AWS cloud services (EC2, Lambda, S3, Rekognition, CloudFront) and created the front-end using React.
